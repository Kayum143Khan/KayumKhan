      <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Kayum Khan</strong> — a computer science student, passionate educator, and full-stack web developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Welcome to my personal website, a space where I share my journey through code, creativity, and community-building.</p>

  <p>With a strong foundation in technologies like <em>React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Visual Studio</em>, I specialize in building responsive websites and crafting tutorials that make learning web development accessible for everyone. Whether it's a sleek landing page or a structured HTML guide, I’m always thinking about the user experience and how to make information intuitive and engaging.</p>

  <p>What drives me is the belief that education should be both inspiring and inclusive. I often describe myself as “a passionate computer science teacher and lifelong learner.” That mindset has fueled everything from building educational apps to creating video tutorials, slideshow-based lessons, and practical content tailored to students' real-world needs.</p>

  <p>Recently, I’ve been working on expanding the digital presence of organizations like <strong>MK International Student Consultants</strong>, designing educational content that is both culturally relevant and visually impactful. I also enjoy mentoring fellow students and helping others navigate their way through the tech world with confidence.</p>

  <p>If you’re interested in collaboration, learning something new, or just want to connect — feel free to explore, reach out, or dive into my tutorials. Let’s learn and grow together.</p>
